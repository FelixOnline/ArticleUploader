A king advises Santiago, the chief protagonist, that, “when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true.”. This in itself is an uplifting prospect. In spite of this the various realities and sufferings happening around the world on a daily basis demonstrate that this is, all too often, far from the truth. A line that I read in Albert Camus’ The Plague emboldened this for me. “To the day I die I shall refuse to love this creation in which children are tortured.” The so-called ‘lost generation’ of Syrian children serves as a case in point. How can an individual best serve humanity in the modern age while staying true to oneself? One might argue that the 21st century is one of pragmatism, that with a growing population and consumption of both our land and resources, administering to ‘the self’ is fundamentally unjust. The concept of pilgrimage serves as a suitable allegory. People have travelled for centuries, yearning to absorb and utilise as much of our natural world as possible by searching for inner unity and insight. The modern irony is that, when travelling, we actively tarnish the world around us (through travel on planes, trains etc.). Even the pursuit of knowledge via modern channels impinges on the planet (laptops, tablets etc. require both plastic and rare earth metals). This might be perceived to be a negative take on things. The pursuit of knowledge has yielded dividends for humanity as a whole. Particle physics demonstrates that, as we continue to strip layers from the fabric of the universe, there will always be more surprises awaiting us. Modern medicine has extended our life span. Freedom of information undermines inequality. These revelations share the common thread of our humanity in an imperfect world. To my mind Coelho hit the nail on the head in a 2005 New York Times interview, “I believe enlightenment or revelation comes in daily life. I look for joy, the peace of action. You need action.” In brief, it could be argued that, in searching for our personal legend in the 21st century, we affect (for better or worse) humanity’s collective legend. We cannot turn back. Our sphere of existence is what it is. Each one of us will do as we always have and administer to ourselves. Who knows? The world may change for the better by doing so.</Text></Article><Article><Author>Pietro Aronica </Author><Text>On the 27th of November 2013 at 17:43 Silvio Berlusconi was expelled from the Senate of the Italian Republic; he no longer represents anyone but himself. He cannot abuse his parliamentary seat anymore to avoid his legal troubles. He cannot run for office and may even  be tried for his various crimes. In a way, if you’ll forgive me a cliché, it’s the end of an era. Berlusconi has warped and corrupted Italian politics by neglecting the country to solve his personal issues. He has created a barbarous culture of illegality. The right has become a joke (divided between xenophobes and his spineless serfs). The left has either been entrenched in its own pseudo-intellectualism or too complacent to fight him properly. Furthermore, another party has risen as the direct expression of Berlusconi’s message of base populism, appeal to the masses and divinely inspired self-righteousness.  With his political demise, however, we can, perhaps,  hope to move on. Maybe we’ll get a political party worthy of definition instead of the bands of conniving speculators that mostly sit in parliament. Maybe we can start discussing the economy, investment in education and research and the role of Europe without having to hold long discussions regarding Berlusconi’s trials. Maybe we can extirpate the mentality of illegality that he has protected and fostered. I, for one, am not going to hold my breath. I’ve been awaiting this moment for many years, and I don’t mean my adult life. As a child I remember being lectured on how Berlusconi was a crook and a cheater. Luckily, at that time, his crimes ‘merely’ consisted of tax evasion, fraud, Mafia deals and conspiracy against the state, so I was spared from having to learn about prostitution rings. Despite this, Berlusconi has always been the central player of Italian politics as long as I’ve been able to rudimentarily understand it (if anyone can claim to). You might infer that the end of his reign should be a significant event. Despite the momentousness of what has happened I cannot cheer. Berlusconi has made the country poorer, both in wealth and spirit. The effects of these twenty years will long outlast him. Apart from running the economy into the ground and making many useless or deleterious reforms, he has made my country the subject of jokes and ridicule. He has forced me, along with thousands of my compatriots, to leave Italy, in order to find proper studying opportunities (let alone work). He has prolonged the culture of chauvinism, homophobia and intolerance that other, better nations have already begun to cast off. Only Mussolini has done a worse job at running Italy and he had to ally  with the Nazis to accomplish that. This is not something that can be solved overnight. People vote for him in droves because he has an iron grip on the minds of many. He has inculcated a mentality of nepotism and corruption in Italy that has taken root to unprecedented levels. There have been corrupt people in Italy before (including corrupt people in charge) but none of them have been so successful at it. None have been so unrepentant, so blatant, in their disregard for the common good. There are millions who believe his falsehoods and it will take nothing short of an entire generational change to finally rid us of his shameful legacy. If this comes across as bitter and hopeless it’s because I am, profoundly so. The mere fact that we have to celebrate when a senator is expelled from Parliament on fraud charges testifies to how anomalous the Italian situation has become. I will keep on following the political scene and voting. I will do all else that I can do from here. Perhaps I’ll return one day, better equipped to help than I am now.  Italy will otherwise remain a disappointment for me, a country of great culture, of immense value and potential, a nation that could and should help Europe and the world. Alas, it is shackled by ineffective and corrupt leaders. When I see the latest news on the weather, wreaking havoc thanks to corrupt administrators, mothers forcing their underage daughters into prostitution or the widespread and  barbarous exhibitions of racist mentality or a magnate that lies his way to freedom (and dupes millions while those who should fight him are too spineless, litigious or outright accomplices to do so). I am reminded of my favourite definition of Italy; a heaven inhabited by demons. </Text><Blockquote>“Perhaps I’ll return one day, better equipped to help than I am now.

No matter how overwhelmed you’re feeling, there are always some parties that you will just refuse to miss, because everyone knows that reservations and propriety fly out the window as soon as mulled wine and mistletoe are involved. Whether you’re the kind of person who’s at the front line of the drama, or you just like watching it unfold, Christmas parties are often unmissable, and a good way to release the stress that’s gradually built up throughout the term.  So we get it; no matter what  else you should be doing, Christmas (or other seasonal celebrations) parties are always fun and we should make sure that we find time to enjoy them. But what if you really need to be studying for those exams, and the constant study guilt prevents you from relaxing properly? I think that I solved this problem, and I would encourage you to do the same: turn the festivities into study material.  Are you an engineer? Use some of your recently-acquired skills to build something challenging. Out of gingerbread. Are you a physicist or mathematician? Conduct an analysis of the flows of people around the mistletoe. A medic? Examine alcohol related injuries and offer your friends hangover cures. Not obviously specialised to the season, but you’ll make a lot of people happy if you do it wearing antlers or a Santa hat. You get the idea; every subject can be adapted to some festive fun. You’re studying at Imperial because at some point, you decided that you love your subject. It’s really easy to lose track of that amidst all the maths lectures and tedious labs, so why not use Christmas as an opportunity to take a step back and do something not directly related to your course purely because you enjoy it. It won’t necessarily get you better marks in that coursework (unless someone’s involved in a project investigating the material properties of gingerbread, please someone let me know if that is actually a thing), or help you remember that equation you’re inevitably going to forget in your upcoming exam, but it might rejuvenate your passion for your subject, which will help get you through all those times over the holidays when you’ll be cracking open your textbooks when all your non-Imperial friends are passed out in a food coma at the foot of the Christmas tree.  Everyone needs a break now and then, but you’ll feel a bit less guilty about the time off if you utilise it in a somewhat productive manner. And if, like me, you opt for a giant gingerbread creation, you’ll find that offloading large quantities of sugar onto your friends does wonders for your social standing.</Text><Subheadline>And not feel (too) guilty about it</Subheadline><Author>Tessa Davey</Author></Article><Article><Headline>Christmas Confessions of a GTA</Headline><Text>Christmas at Imperial as an undergrad quite literally sucks. All I can remember was all my friends from alternative universities having a fantastic time with mulled wine, carols, slightly questionable decisions at the Christmas dinners,  and retiring home to make snowmen with all their lovely family. Meanwhile I had more than five peices of coursework on the go, numerous tests, and ‘fun’ end of term activities on my course, that were hideously weighted so you could not pass if you were slightly the worse for wear in the morning. Instead of acting out the Christmas dream, I was struggling to get out of the department, at all. I often found myself wondering what halls actually looked like at this time of year, or whether it was light outside (there’s an app for that). I was at my most excited on the last day of term, at my joyful reunion with my bed.  The low point had to be fourth year. My course was such that I had finals in January, and not mid to late January, but starting on the 5th. That holiday, I took one day off for Christmas. It always baffled me why Imperial was confused about the low satisfaction ratings. Tests on a Friday afternoon on the last day of term are not exactly a positive influence on our mood levels. This year, looking at it from the other side, the undergrads look as ill as I felt. I have three invigilations booked in the next two weeks and still more for the first week of January. So I’m afraid it is not looking bright for a change in the future. So for all of you who are suffering this I wanted to instil a bit of Christmas hope; It really does get better. I’ve always thought I hated Christmas. All the pressure to be happy and thrilled about life, but actually it is pretty great when you don’t think you are going to fail anything if you take the weekend to go shopping. Suddenly I was helping with a carol concert, putting up decorations, enjoying a mulled cider, and chatting about the possibility of snow. I have two weeks off! This has not happened since mock GCSEs over 7 years ago.  So my confession for this week, though not as cheery as I would like is: if this rings a bell with you, keep going. There will be Christmases around the corner where you can get completely drunk at a party and hit on someone you’ll never talk to again, but right now enjoy the little things like half price mince pies or finishing that stupid coursework. If we made it through you can too. </Text><Author>The GTA</Author><Image href_fmt="images/christmas_unicorn_fmt.jpeg" href="file:///Volumes/Groups/Felix/Felix%202013-14/CURRENT%20ISSUE/Comment/christmas_unicorn.psd"></Image><Subheadline>There will come a time when you don’t have to work at Christmas</Subheadline></Article><Article><Headline>Student Protests in Ukraine</Headline><Text>The dramatic events in Ukraine in recent weeks have again brought the country into the headlines. The mainly student protests in Kiev are about reneged promises over further integration with the EU. Before we come to the table with our personal prejudices and biases over the EU (and both UKIP and the idiotic liberal reaction to UKIP suggest we have many) we need to remember Edward Said’s warning that very few political principles survive translation, inserted, as they are, into a new set of power relations. The first directly relevant point here is that Ukraine is the world’s third largest exporter of grain. Certainly the EU protects its farmers (and as a leftist I should like to point out the cost to third world farmers that this protectionist policy has) and Ukraine has much to gain from joining the EU. However, as the continuing economic crises in Greece, Spain etc. show, the integration of a notoriously fragile economy into the EU may well be tantamount to handing the keys over to Germany. EU aside, there is the ever perennial Big Brother to the East. Putin clearly doesn’t want Ukraine to integrate more with the EU, and the oil debacles in 2006 and 2009 show Putin isn’t scared of punishing sheep that stray too far from the flock. The criminal actions in Chechnya are perhaps a more sinister example. This brings us nicely to internal politics: President Yanukovych was widely seen as the ‘Russian’ candidate in the 2004 ‘election’, and indeed the base of his support is in the predominantly ethnically Russian east. Ukraine is infamous for its East/West divide, with the country more pro-Soviet as you head east, and these protests have once again thrown this factor into relief.  Yanukovych is without doubt a dubious character, with very serious allegations of corruption levelled at him, despite the highfalutin rhetoric. Then there was the blatant electoral fraud in 2004 which led to the Orange Revolution. The revolution was perhaps more of the type we physicists are used to dealing with as Yanukovych soon saw himself back in power in 2010, elected in perhaps the cleanest election in the post-Soviet bloc to date. Mind you, Yulia Tymoshenko is not perhaps as much the fairy-tale candidate that Guardian readers would like to believe. Perhaps this is just prejudice, but I am not sure that becoming one of the richest people in the country during a period where GDP shrunk to 40% of its Soviet era economy is quite justified by business sense and initiative. Despite the personal difficulties she has no doubt faced since her arrest in 2001, it was the incompetence and infighting of the Orange revolutionaries that brought Yanukovych back to power. Finally, Tymoshenko is all too cosy with the wrong sorts of people: note her meetings with Dick Cheney and Condoleeza Rice in 2007, or her transformation into Russia’s preferred candidate in 2010. One final word: democratic uprisings have a life of their own. Slavoj Žižek once made a wonderful point about how best to rewrite Antigone. Forget the fights between Creon and Antigone, the chorus should send both to the prison camps and start life in a new commune. My call to the people of Ukraine is analogous; forget the Mafioso politicians and gas baronesses. Unite and protest! </Text><Image href_fmt="images/ukraine_fmt.jpeg" href="file:///Volumes/Groups/Felix/Felix%202013-14/CURRENT%20ISSUE/Comment/ukraine.psd"></Image><Author>Christy Kelly</Author></Article></Section>
